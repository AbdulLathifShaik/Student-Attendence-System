The Smart Attendance System is a responsive web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently mark and manage attendance by entering basic details like name and email, which are stored along with the current date and time. The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the browserâ€™s LocalStorage, making it ideal for small organizations, classrooms, or teams that need a lightweight and offline-capable attendance solution. The interface is designed with Bootstrap and custom CSS to ensure a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly experience. Users can easily view, edit, or delete records, and the data remains persistent even after refreshing the page.
